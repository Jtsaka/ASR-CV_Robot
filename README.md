# Robot_project
This project involves manipulating robot movement using computer vision via YOLOv8 and ASR using OpenAI's Whisper model. 
Leveraging these technologies allows the robot to make more informed and complex movments.
By inserting an audio file, a user can command the robot to varying actions, as well as command it to utilize its computer vision system to align itself to an object and translate to its position.
